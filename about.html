      <h3>Product Description</h3>
      <p>
        FinSight Benchmark is a standalone, AI-powered financial analysis tool designed to help businesses evaluate
        their financial performance using industry-based benchmarks. By analyzing key financial ratios such as
        liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and leverage, the platform provides companies with immediate insights
        into how well they are performing compared to competitors in the same industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional accounting software, FinSight Benchmark focuses on interpretation rather than data entry.
        It transforms raw financial numbers into understandable results, explanations, and actionable business advice.
